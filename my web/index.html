            My Dream of Becoming a Web developer.As a young child, my dream
            occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests
            changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these
            dreams were not very long lived, one occupational dream has
            outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I
            passionately pursue.</b

          knows how to: Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery,

        <p>
          A Junior Web Developer works with a team of developers to create new
          websites and applications. The “junior” designation means you work
          under the supervision of senior developers in your department, but you
          may be involved in all stages of the project, from brainstorming to
          final testing.
